# 🎭 Face Emotion Classification using YOLOv11 | Python + Deep Learning  

In this repository, you’ll learn how to build a **Face Emotion Classification System** using the latest **YOLOv11 Classification Model**.  
You’ll discover how to download and organize your dataset, train YOLOv11 for emotion detection, and visualize predictions on test images.  

We’ll go step by step — from dataset setup to model training and testing — all using **Python, OpenCV, and Ultralytics YOLOv11**.
